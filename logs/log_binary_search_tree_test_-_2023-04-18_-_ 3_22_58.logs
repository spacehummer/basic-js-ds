  Binary search tree
    variable presence
      ✔ class BinarySearchTree exists
      ✔ correct inheritance
      ✔ has methods
    functional requirements
      ✔ returns correct root if no value added
      ✔ root works correctly some values were added
      1) find existing values
      ✔ find non-existing values
      2) correctly checks presence of the values
      3) remove & has works correctly
      4) min works correctly
      5) max works correctly
    some additional tests
      6) correctly find min & max
      7) correctly find values
      8) correctly remove values
