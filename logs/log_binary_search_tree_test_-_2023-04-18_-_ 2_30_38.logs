  Binary search tree
    variable presence
      ✔ class BinarySearchTree exists
      ✔ correct inheritance
      1) has methods
    functional requirements
      2) returns correct root if no value added
      3) root works correctly some values were added
      - find existing values
      - find non-existing values
